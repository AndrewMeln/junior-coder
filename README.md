<h2>This is a website that functions as a blog.</h2>
The main user - superuser - can manage this blog: add/ change/ delete posts, assign permissions to authorized users.

To authorize you need to click on the button on the left-top of the page. You will be redirected to the page of authorization.
If you haven't registered yet you need to click on the link below the form authorization.
Unauthorized users can only read posts. After authorization, all users can comment posts and if superuser assign permissions to them, they be able to change posts.
Each authorized users have link to restricted administration site but if they don't have staff status they don't manage to come in.
This function is necessary to avoid changing posts by every authorized users.

One page of the blog has ten last posts (information about post: title, author name, date published and some part of article).
